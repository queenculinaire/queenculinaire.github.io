Hello and welcome my foodies! This is my internet hide-out for people like me who live for the next meal…or snack…or smoothie…or sweet treat…you get the picture. Welcome to this haven for obsessing over everything that is good, from gooey melty mac and cheese to dense fudgy brownies to fresh zingy cocktails and everything in between! Having just graduated from law school, I get to spend all my time now scouring food magazines, recipe books, and the internet for new inspiration and exciting places to travel and eat. I’ll be sharing some of my favourite places to visit, and the best restaurants and bars of course. Anyone who has been on vacation with me knows that the days are entirely structured around getting from one eating-stop to the next, with a little culture, shopping and sightseeing thrown in to spice things up.

Cooking is my passion. I love it. Seeing the expression on someone’s face when they take that first bite of something I have created is absolutely priceless. I love spending my days mixing and inventing in the kitchen and now I want to be able to share all this deliciousness with you all. I want you to be able to bask in the glow of good food and drink as much as I do, and to get that buzz from creating something delicious.

 

As well as cooking, I also love entertaining. Party planning is my jam: creating a menu plan, going grocery shopping, whipping up a batch of cocktails and canapés, then getting to enjoy quality time spent with great food and even greater people. What could be better? I am here to help you to become the hostess with the mostess, absolutely stress free. Because nothing ruins a party quicker than stress! Do like R Kelly guys, happy people!
