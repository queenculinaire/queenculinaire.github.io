Guuuuys, I have been dying to share these with you all weekend but it was a busy one! How was your weekend? Hopefully filled with fun times, good memories and some delicious eats! Everyone keeps saying summer is officially over, but it’s never too late for ice cream sandwiches, amirite?!

The first time I ever had an ice cream sandwich was in Venice Beach, CA. It was only my second visit ever to the USA and I was in heaven! I could not, and still to this day cannot, understand why we don’t make ice cream sandwiches in the UK! What could be better than two soft chocolatey cookies wrapped around a big scoop of ice cream!?

Two fruity pebbles cereal treats wrapped around a big scoop of condensed milk ice cream, that’s what. I know everyone is into cereal milk ice cream at the moment, à la [Momofuku Milk Bar](http://milkbarstore.com/main/), but i wanted to go old school. If you have ever just dipped a spoon into a can of condensed milk, you know what I’m talking about. Oh yeahhhh. Nothing beats that. So I made this super simple, two ingredient ice cream that is perfectly reminiscent of those naughty spoonfuls of condensed milk.

And it doesn’t even need churning! I owe this one to my mother, she introduced me to a slightly different version of it (more on that in a few weeks!) and it is unbeatable for its simplicity and reward to effort ratio.

As I mentioned in my [funfetti blondie bar post](https://queenculinaire.github.io/frosted-funfetti-blondie-bars/), I love sprinkles. This love also extends to anything artificially rainbow coloured. So fruity pebbles were going to have to make an appearance on the blog at some point. Now I have tasted the wonders of a fruity pebbles treat, I cannot understand why anyone would make them with plain old rice krispies. And these are SO much prettier! You have to take pleasure in the simple (rainbow-coloured) things in life, right?

### Recipe
+ Serves: 5
+ Time: 
  + Prep: 10 mins
  + Cook: 20 mins
  + Passive: 6 hrs
#### Ingredients
+ for the ice cream
  + 2 1/8 cups heavy cream
  + 1 14oz can condensed milk
+ for the fruity pebbles treats
  + 1 stick unsalted butter
  + 8 oz marshmallows
  + 1 tsp vanilla extract
  + 1 pinch salt
  + 4 cups fruity pebbles
+ to decorate:
  + 2 cups white chocolate chips
  + 1 cup fruity pebbles

#### Instructions
For the ice cream
1. Pour the cream into a large bowl and using an electric whisk, beat to soft peaks. Pour in the condensed milk and beat again for about 15-20 seconds to combine. Pour into a loaf tin and pop it in the freezer, no need to churn! Leave to freeze until solid, about 4-5 hours.

For the fruity pebbles treats
1. Melt the butter and marshmallows in a large saucepan over a low heat. Add the salt and vanilla. Once all the marshmallows have melted, add the cereal and stir well to make sure it is all coated. Using an ice cream scoop, portion out 10 scoops of the mixture onto a parchment lined tray, then use the back of a spoon to flatten each one into a cookie shape. Leave to set in the fridge for about 30 minutes.

To decorate
1. Once your ice cream is frozen and your "cookies" have firmed up, make up your sandwiches using one scoop of ice cream per pair of cookies. Squish it down a little between the two "cookies" so it reaches the edges (the softer the ice cream here the better).
1. Next, melt the white chocolate. I find the safest way to do this, as white chocolate burns easily, is to use a double boiler. Get a small saucepan and put about an inch of water in it, then bring it to a boil. Turn the heat down so the water is no longer bubbling, then place a heatproof bowl over the pan, so it sits on the rim of the pan but doesn't touch the water. Add the chocolate chips. Once they turn shiny, stir well with a spatula and take the bowl off the heat. Cover half of each sandwich in white chocolate and roll the side in fruity pebbles.
1. Leave to set up in the freezer on a parchment lined tray for about 20 minutes. EAT!!!

#### Notes
When using white chocolate for melting, buy a good quality brand. Don't expect it to be as runny as melted milk chocolate, you have to take it off the heat when it still doesn't quite look melted or it will form a big old clump and become unusable.

These bad boys will last up to 2 months in the freezer, just pop them in freezer bags or wrap well in plastic wrap.

There will be plenty of ice cream left over, I'll leave it up to you guys to work out what to do with it! I'm sure it'll disappear before you know it!
