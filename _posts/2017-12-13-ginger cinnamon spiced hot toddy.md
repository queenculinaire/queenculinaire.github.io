Just as it’s beginning to feel a lot like Christmas, it’s also starting to feel a lot like flu season! So I’m here to the rescue with a warming hot toddy to alleviate those winter blues. Yes, there’s bourbon. And honey, lemon and spices. All the good stuff. And some ginger for added health benefits. Always gotta balance out the bourbon with some health!

If you don’t already own a jar of ginger in syrup, then you need to go get yourself some! It is the absolute bomb, perfect for a whole variety of things at this time of year. In cocktails, drizzled over ice cream, folded into whipped cream to top pies. Did someone say pumpkin pie with ginger whipped cream?? Mmmm.

I love the clove-studded lemon slices in these toddies. When I was younger, my mum and I would always make what are called pomanders at Christmas. You take a couple of oranges, and stud them all over with cloves. You can make whatever pattern takes your fancy, then tie a piece of Christmassy ribbon around them and hang them as scented decorations around your home. The smell alone is SO festive you’ll wonder why you haven’t been making them all this time.

They’re also a great budget-friendly option to decorate with. You can buy big bags of cloves at your local Indian supermarket. They are so so much cheaper than the tiny little pots you find at the grocery store. In fact, at this time of year when we use more spices than usual, I would highly recommend finding your closest Indian or Asian supermarket and stocking up. I got some beautiful cinnamon sticks for an outrageously low price the other week. Other things to pick up while you’re there include cardamom, fresh ginger, generous bunches of fresh mint, peppercorns (for your brining!) and fruits like mango and pineapple. They also usually carry a great range of tropical and exotic fruit juices if you’re thinking of making punch or cocktails over the festive period. Enjoy!
