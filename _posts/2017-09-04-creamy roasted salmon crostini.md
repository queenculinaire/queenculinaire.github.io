Happy weekend guys! Before I get onto the salmon I just wanted to tell you what I’ve been up to! This weekend is pretty special because I get to attend my boyfriend’s childhood best friend’s wedding! Shoutout to Parker and Brady! We had the rehearsal dinner last night which is a first for me as a Brit! We don’t have a tradition of rehearsal dinners in the UK, but it was absolutely lovely. Seems like a great idea, why not have more celebrations if you can!?

Speaking of parties, if you read my ‘About me’ section, you’ll see that I promise to make you the hostess with the mostess (or host with the most!). The trick to being a great host and having a successful and enjoyable party is being prepared. Having a few key recipes under your belt is key.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but to me, it ain’t a party if there aren’t nibbles! If you ever see me at a formal event, you can single me out as the girl chasing the waiter with the hors d’oeuvre tray around the room.

Obviously, this kinda thing can get expensive, so I have created this recipe to help keep party costs down but still have delicious and elegant hors d’oeuvres. Usually, I would use a hot smoked salmon, but boy is that stuff expensive in the supermarket! Instead, I get a little piece of salmon and roast it in the oven. Just as tasty and far less expensive!

Once you’ve roasted the salmon, which you could do in advance if you like, this takes a few minutes to whip up in your stand mixer or food processor.

So easy.

Looks fancy.

Perfect party food!

### Recipe
+ Serves: 10 as an hors d'oeuvre
+ Cooking time: 30 mins
#### Ingredients
+ 1/2 lb salmon (I like coho, make sure it is deboned and skinless)
+ 2 tbsp chopped chives
+ 2/3 cup cream cheese
+ 1 tsp salt
+ 2 tbsp lemon juice
+ to serve: day old baguette

#### Instructions
1. Begin by preheating the oven to 400, then lining a baking dish with parchment paper. Place the salmon inside the dish and once the oven has heated up, bake for about 18 minutes, until the fish is cooked all the way through. Let it cool to room temperature.
1. In the bowl of your stand mixer (paddle attachment) or in your food processor, whip up the cream cheese until it is softened and smooth, then add in the salt, lemon juice and salmon. Fold in or blend until combined, then stir in the chives.
1. To prepare the baguette, simply slice thinly, brush with olive oil and broil until golden (be careful it doesn't take long!).
1. Spread the salmon dip onto the toasts, top with more chives and plenty of freshly cracked black pepper. Voilà!
