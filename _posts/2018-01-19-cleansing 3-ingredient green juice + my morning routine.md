Hello hello! Yes, I’m back with another super easy recipe to throw into your healthy January repertoire! I took inspiration from Alison Wu’s post about drinking celery juice in the mornings, you can find it [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BZ_rRyGjoLx/?taken-by=alison__wu). Her pictures are so beautiful and creative, I am very much in awe of her artistic talent and her ability to make healthy living so beautiful. I like to amp up the flavour of this green juice with some heat from the ginger and a little tang from the lime. It’s perfect, almost salty savoury and makes a great alternative to those sugar-loaded juices. Fruit is wonderful, but it’s crazy how much sugar pressed fruit juice can contain. Not the best way to start the day!

I’ve been watching some of those morning routine videos on Youtube recently and I love getting that little insight into how people shape their day. So, for those of you who are weird and nosy like me, here’s a little breakdown on how my mornings usually look. It goes one of two ways, depending on how hungry I am. If I wake up starving, I’ll do oats or a smoothie bowl. In the UK, we call oatmeal porridge, which definitely draws a few blank looks when I’m stateside! Also, being British, the day HAS to start with a good strong cup of tea, with a dash of milk. No green tea. No caffe latte moccachino. No fancy matcha. Plain old builders tea (what we call strong tea in the UK). I recently made the switch to goats milk to try and do a little bit for the environment. Cows just produce too much methane!

Anyway, back to the oats! I like to make mine in the microwave, then I add egg whites and cook until they’re thick and creamy. Stir a little sweetener and cocoa powder through and you are set. So good. If I’m in more of a hurry, I’ll just stir through a scoop of chocolate peanut-butter flavoured protein powder once the oats are cooked. Maybe throw a few raspberries in if there are any lurking in the fridge. Another option is a protein smoothie bowl, something like this [pumpkin spice one](https://queenculinaire.github.io/vegan-pumpkin-spice-superfood-protein-smoothie/). I’ll follow up later this month with a few more of my favourite smoothie bowls! I like to top mine with granola, chia seeds, hemp seeds and maybe some berries.

If I wake up not so hungry, I like to pour myself a little glass of kefir (for those of you stateside, the low fat plain kefir from Trader Joe’s is bomb). I love how tangy and thick and creamy it is. I’ll also make myself a tall glass of this green juice and sip on that. This is great if I know I’ll be having an early lunch or a heavy meal at lunch time as I’ll definitely be hungry by then, whereas the oats keep me stuffed full for hours!

I’d love to hear from you guys about your morning routines and favourite breakfast options, so hit me up in the comments section! Also, I’m sure you don’t need me to remind you how expensive those juices from the Whole Foods Juice Bar are, and how cheap a head of celery is. Make a batch of this green juice and take it to work with you in a bottle or a mason jar. Keep it in the fridge, then just shake it up before you drink it! It lasts up to 2 days in the fridge.

### Recipe
+ Serves: 2
+ Time:
  + Prep: 10
#### Ingredients
+ 2 limes
+ 1 head celery (preferably organic)
+ 2-3 inch piece of ginger

#### Instructions
1. Juice the celery and ginger in a juicier. Use a citrus attachment or a regular lemon squeezer to juice the limes. Combine and serve over ice.

#### Notes
If you don't have a juicer but you still want to try this out, pop the celery and ginger into a smoothie-maker/blender then strain through a fine mesh sieve to remove the stringy bits from the celery. Add the lime juice and serve as described above.
