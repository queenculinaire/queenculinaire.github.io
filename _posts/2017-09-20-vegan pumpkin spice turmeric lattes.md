Happy Humpday everyone! Today I’m bringing you a slightly less guilty way to get your PSL (pumpkin spice latte, for those not in the know) fix! If you saw my [pumpkin spice carrot cake](https://queenculinaire.github.io/pumpkin-spice-carrot-cake-with-cream-cheese-frosting/), you’ll know I did promise a pumpkin spice latte this week. So I came through for you, because I know that the pumpkin cravings are getting stronger as the temperatures drop and the leaves begin to fall, amirite?! Anyway, I don’t think that it would be permissible to say pumpkin spice one more time in this post.

Turmeric. Such a buzzword these days, but I have been consuming it, mainly in curries, for years! One word of warning for anyone who hasn’t used it before. It stains like CRAZY. So please be careful if you have white kitchen worktops or light clothing on, try not to spill it and keep some bleach handy!

In order for the useful compound (curcumin) in the turmeric to activate, you need a little black pepper with it too. In the recipe I’ve just used a pinch, but if you like something a bit punchier, feel free to use a bit more! Also, if you would like to read a little more about turmeric and the benefits it can provide, [this](https://www.livestrong.com/article/404629-what-are-turmeric-curcumin-good-for/) is a good place to start.

I love this drink because it provides such a good balance between naughty indulgence and healthy benefits. It also tastes DIVINE. The colour is pretty sweet too, and it’s the perfect thing to take up to bed with you of an evening because it’s completely caffeine-free. I am such a sucker for any kind of alternative to plain old tea or coffee, and this is great because it’s naturally sweetened and isn’t laden with a bunch of artificial flavourings or nasties like a frappalattemochachino might be. Seriously though, if fancy drinks are your thing, I’m your girl. Bubble tea, thai tea, matcha lattes, nitro cold brew, milk tea with salted cheese. Give me all the drinks!!

I’m guessing you would like an explanation of how salted cheese and tea go together. Well, last year I saw it while I was deep browsing the foodweb. I came across [this](http://www.happy-lemon.com/en/drink/drink.php) website and managed to get my hands on some of it while I was in London. I’ve since tracked it down in Dallas at [85C Bakery](http://www.85cbakerycafe.com/). You NEED to try it, it’s so good, like cream cheese frosting on top of bubble tea. Mmmmmm. So creamy and delicious.

### Recipe
+ Serves: 2
+ Time:
  + Prep: 10 mins
  + Cook: 5 mins
#### Ingredients
+ lattes
  + 2 tbsp pumpkin purée
  + 2 tsp maple syrup
  + 1 pinch ground black pepper
  + 1/4 tsp ground ginger
  + 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
  + 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
  + 2 cups dairy-free milk almond or cashew are my favourites
+ to serve (optional)
  + 1 can coconut milk refrigerated overnight

#### Instructions
1. In a small saucepan, combine the spices and the maple syrup. Use a small whisk to combine.
1. Add the milk and whisk until smooth. Heat over a medium heat until just beginning to simmer.
1. If you want a frothier drink, you could pour this into your smoothie maker or use an electric frother. If not, that's cool too! Simply pour your lattes into two mugs.
1. If desired, top with coconut whipped cream (see notes) and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Enjoy!

#### Notes
To make the whipped coconut cream, take your refrigerated coconut milk (DON'T SHAKE IT) and scoop out the solids from the can. You can keep the liquid for smoothies. Using a hand beater or stand mixer with the whisk attachment, beat until soft peaks form. This can be made a few hours ahead and refrigerated until needed!
