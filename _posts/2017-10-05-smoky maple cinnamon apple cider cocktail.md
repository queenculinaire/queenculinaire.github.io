All the cozy fall ingredients. All in one cocktail. Happy humpday guys! This one is easy to throw together and tastes like one of those fancy cocktails you’d pay $15 for in a snazzy bar. It also tastes like autumn. Thick knitted sweaters, trees shedding their burnished copper leaves, bonfires and fireworks, afternoons by the fire getting stuck into a new book, the sound of the rain tapping against the windows.

You might think the combination of mezcal and bourbon is weird, but seriously, try it. You get that delicious sweet depth from the bourbon and all the smokiness of the mezcal. Perfect. I love trying new things, and being from England, the concept of apple cider is new to me. At home, apple cider is sold alongside beer and is sparkling and alcoholic. The stuff here in the States is totally different, more like a good quality fresh pressed apple juice. Which goes so perfectly with a little cinnamon and maple syrup.

Speaking of cinnamon, I think I have developed an unhealthy obsession with cinnamon sticks as a garnish. Try lighting the end of yours until it is smouldering if you’re feeling adventurous. It adds a wonderful aroma to the drink. I first experienced it at one of my all time favourite cocktail hangouts, the [Roosevelt Room](https://therooseveltroomatx.com/) in Austin. They have a signature drink called the cigar box which is smoky and divine. If you are in Austin, be sure to try it out.

I also love these miniature pumpkins. So cute. I’ve never seen anything like this back in the UK, and I definitely want to get hold of some seeds to grow these myself next year! I got mine from [Trader Joe’s](https://www.traderjoes.com/), which was bursting with glorious fall-related products. I was in absolute heaven. I’d love to know what some of your favourite TJ’s products are!

I’m off to the Dallas Arboretum tonight to make some Chinese lanterns and marvel at the pumpkin display. Very exciting! I just wish I could be wrapped up in winter gear not shorts and a t-shirt. Ah well. I’m sure I’ll be eating my hat when I get back to the UK in a few weeks and missing the sunshine. Just to add even more excitement to the mix, my boyfriend’s family are going to celebrate Thanksgiving early so that we can all take part, DEEP FRIED TURKEY COME AT ME! I cannot wait. Sunday will be epic.
