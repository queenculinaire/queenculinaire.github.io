Cherry. Chocolate. Vodka. Your new three favourite words. So just for you, I made them into a cocktail.

So if you saw the [first post](https://queenculinaire.com/2017/09/06/cherry-syrup-bourbon-cherry-sour/) on cherry syrup, then you’ll know that I promised you a creamy, dreamy dessert cocktail today. So here it is! If you like chocolate and you like cherries then this is gonna be your jam. Well, your drink. It is SO easy, uses only 4 ingredients, and tastes so naughty.

Creamy cocktails never used to be my thing, so I rarely ordered them or made them. But oh boy, once you give in and try them, they are SO GOOD! Seriously, if you’re one of those people that thinks creamy cocktails are too much then just trust me and try this. You’ll be pouring yourself seconds.

Did I mention it’s pink? The prettiest pastel shade of pink that will be the envy of any of your guests who opted for a cup of coffee instead. I love serving it in these little milk bottles, like an adult milkshake. Kitsch, yes. Irresistible, yes also. If you wanted to take it up a notch, you could rim some martini glasses in melted white chocolate and dip them in sprinkles. I wouldn’t be above that. It’s dessert after all! Give your guests something to remember, something they’re going to tell their friends about. The best compliment you can ever get after a party is your guests asking you for the recipe for something. That is true food love right there.

And they are gonna want to recreate this one at home. So go, make it! Quickly before cherry season is over and everything turns pumpkin!
