So, summer is officially upon us. I am in England for the moment, and in traditional English fashion, I can’t help but start the conversation with the weather, typical Brit. Anyway, the evenings are drawing out longer and longer, giving us so much more time to enjoy one of the best things about summer…cocktails!

Just picture yourself sat outside, watching the sun dip down, with an icy glass of white sangria, bursting with juicy peaches and sweet-tart raspberries… Make tonight that night!

I have been making this sangria for years, and it is always a hit, even with those people who usually won’t venture away from a beer.

Its big-batch so its super easy to make for a get-together, plus it actually gets better if you leave it in the fridge for a couple of hours so you can tick it off in advance and focus your energy on the next most important thing… nibbles!

I also love this recipe because it doesn’t require anything fancy, and you can adapt it to what you already have at home, so no need for a last-minute frantic grocery store run.

Stone fruit is abundant during the summer, and there’s nothing better than those booze-soaked slices left at the bottom of your glass when you’ve finished this!

### Recipe
Serves: 4
Cooking time: 15 mins
#### Ingredients
+ 1 bottle sweet white wine (like Liebfraumilch or Riesling)
+ 1 cup Triple Sec or Cointreau
+ 2 cups raspberries
+ 1 orange, sliced
+ 3 white peaches, stoned and sliced
+ simple syrup, to taste (see notes)

#### Instructions
0. Fill a large pitcher with the peaches, raspberries and orange slices.
0. Add the alcohol, stir and add the simple syrup until desired sweetness is reached, 1 tablespoon at a time.
0. Refrigerate until ready to drink, or top with ice and drink right away! This can be made a couple of hours ahead, and actually improves with time in the fridge!
0. Pour, sip and enjoy!

#### Notes
To make simple syrup, combine 1 part water with 1 part sugar in a small pan, and stir over a low heat until dissolved. Allow to cool. Can be stored in a sterile jar in the pantry for up to 2 months.
