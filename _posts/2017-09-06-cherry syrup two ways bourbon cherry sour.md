Yes, I know it’s September but there are definitely still cherries and berries in the stores so it’s definitely still summer! A couple of weeks ago we visited some picturesque lakes in Montana and Idaho, so obviously I brought a bag full of cherries all the way back with me. Because apparently the North West has a thing for cherry season, so I happily indulged.

If you read the [last post](https://queenculinaire.com/2017/09/04/creamy-roasted-salmon-crostini/), then you’ll know that we’re all about entertaining at the moment. So once you’ve whipped up a batch of crostini, invited all your friends over, then all that is left is the drinks! So I have two super easy, ultra seasonal cocktails for you. If you want to make a pitcher, no problem! Just multiply the quantities by how many guests you have and stir everything together with a bar spoon in a jug. Best not to fill the jug with ice if  you’re not going to be pouring everyone’s drink immediately so it doesn’t get too diluted!

First, get some of this divine cherry syrup going on the stove. This couldn’t be easier; it’s just cherries, water and sugar. You know I like making things that can serve many purposes and oh is this one of them! You can have it with seltzer water for a quick non-alcoholic drink or pour it over vanilla ice cream. Drizzle a little over a crispy skinned duck breast for dinner. Make an italian soda if you have a lil heavy cream in the fridge. So many options.

This first cocktail is a riff on a whiskey sour, so it has the perfect balance of sweet and tart, boozy and fruity. This even converted my boyfriend who is NOT a whiskey drinker. I absolutely love making cocktails and I can’t wait to share more with you. If you have any requests then hit me up in the comments section!

I’ll give you a hint of a spoiler… the other cocktail will be on the blog tomorrow.

Aaaand, it’s a dessert cocktail! (think creamy, chocolatey mmmm)

### Recipe
+ Serves: 2
+ Cooking Time: 20 mins
#### Ingredients
+ for syrup:
  + 2 cups pitted cherries
  + 1 cup sugar
  + 1 cup water
+ for cocktail:
  + 2 oz cherry syrup
  + 2 oz lemon juice
  + 3 oz bourbon

#### Instructions
1. Begin by making the syrup. Combine the ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved, the cherries have broken down a little and it has become thick and syrupy, about 10 minutes.
1. Leave it to cool, then blend in a food processor or smoothie maker. This makes plenty of syrup so store the rest in a clean airtight jar in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
1. For the cocktail, measure all ingredients into a cocktail shaker and shake hard with at least a cup of ice. Strain into ice-filled glasses of your choice and garnish with a few cherries.

#### Notes
If you don't have a cherry pitter, take an empty wine bottle, place the cherry in the opening, and push the stone out using a chopstick.
