So it seems that “dry January” is oh so passé, and we have moved onto “Veganuary” in 2018. So for all of you who are making changes to your diet this month, here’s a lil’ something I made for you. It takes about 2 minutes to make, is packed with beneficial ingredients and superfoods and is totally vegan! A protein smoothie is a great way to start the day, as the protein will keep you fuller for much longer. Also great as a mid-afternoon pick me up and it tastes oh so creamy and indulgent. It’s also totally banana free, cos I know that plenty of you are conscious of all that sugar that’s packed into a banana! This also makes it ideal for those who are banana intolerant.

If bowls are your thing, pour it out into a bowl rather than a glass and top with fresh fruit and granola for a heartier breakfast. Mmmm. Is there anyone out there who doesn’t love granola??! I could eat it 3 times a day, easy.

For those of you who regularly read my blog, you’ll already know that I’m a big fan of turmeric. If you’re looking for something warming and caffeine-free, give these [lattes](https://queenculinaire.com/recipe/vegan-pumpkin-spice-turmeric-lattes/) a go! And if you’re wondering why there’s black pepper in your smoothie, then you can find all the info in that post!

Changing habits can be tough. So if you’re a die-hard Pumpkin Spice Latte fan, this protein smoothie is a great way to wean yourself onto something healthier and more filling. If you’re feeling indulgent, why not top it with some whipped coconut cream. So good. I like to have a little texture with my protein smoothie, hence the toppings. Hemp and chia are great vegan sources of protein too! And I just love the crunch of the cacao nibs and that slightly bitter earthiness they provide. For those mornings where you’re squeezed for time, pour your smoothie into a mason jar and so you can have it at your desk when you get to work. It is SO much cheaper and more environmentally friendly to do this rather than hitting up the fancy new smoothie bar down the block.

The mason jar is reusable and you haven’t already spent $9 by the time you sit down to start work. They do say the New Year is a great time to break bad habits and start new ones, and that doesn’t just have to be about cutting out meat or dairy or grains. It can also be about becoming more environmentally conscious. Those dollar bills that you save each morning, set them aside. Then at the end of each month pick a local charity to donate to, or put it in a savings account to go towards something special. See [this post](https://queenculinaire.com/recipe/white-christmas-coconut-margaritas/) for more on how I approached the festive season with this attitude in mind in 2017. Happy New Year everyone!

  + 1/2 cup pumpkin purée
  + 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
  + 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
  + 1-2 cups ice depending on how thick you like your smoothies
  + 2 scoops vanilla vegan protein powder (optional but recommended!)
  + 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper

  + 2 tbsp non-dairy yogurt
  + 2 tsp shelled hemp seeds

#### Instructions
1. Place all the smoothie ingredients into a high powered blender (Vitamix or Nutribullet kinda thing) and blend until smooth and thick.
1. Divide between two glasses and top with a little yogurt. Go wild with your toppings, pop in a straw and enjoy!

#### Notes
If you have unflavoured protein powder, this works great too. Just be sure to add a little stevia or other sweetener to taste (honey, maple syrup etc) and 1 tsp vanilla extract.
