Hello hello! Sorry to have gone MIA recently. As you can probably guess, the flu got me. I spent the whole week in bed and watched more Netflix and Amazon Prime than I had previously thought was humanly possible. More on that later. First, I wanted to bring you guys a recipe to remind you of summer. Something a lil’ Mediterranean. An appetiser that you can nibble on whilst sipping on some crisp white wine. A dish to share with your friends, and a reason to fry pita breads in copious amounts of olive oil.

Who knew that carbs could be even MORE delicious if we cook them in extra fat?! So good. This baba ganoush is one of my favourite things to make with aubergine (eggplant). You roast them slowly until they are nice and charred, then blend them up with a little seasoning to produce this wonderful, silky smooth roasted eggplant dip that is perfect as part of a mezze spread or just by itself with some pita chips.

And yes, before you ask, a hummus recipe is heading your way soon to accompany the baba ganoush. Everyone is always raving on about the cheese boards, but what about the mezze? What about the dips and pita chips and olives and breads and salads and feta and stuffed vine leaves?! Why does the cheese get all the attention? This baba ganoush is just one component of a traditional mezze spread, and is eaten in many countries including Turkey, Lebanon, Greece and Armenia.

I used to make baba ganoush by broiling the eggplant, but this is a great recipe because you can just leave the aubergines in the oven and busy yourself with other tings without having to worry about setting the house on fire. You can make it a couple of days in advance and just keep it in the fridge, but beware. Spoonfuls of it may just find their way into your mouth without explanation.

Now, having spent so much time watching TV shows over the last week, I thought it only fair to give you guys a few recommendations and let you know what I’ve been watching. So here goes…

![](/images/{{ img_dir }}/6.jpg)

#### The Night Manager (Amazon Prime)
This was just brilliant. It’s like a James Bond film, but it is based on a book by John le Carré. He’s the guy that wrote Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, which is definitely worth a watch if you havent seen it yet. The Night Manager is slick, packed with suspense, wealth, power, bad guys and a hunky hero. Tom Hiddleston is just perfect as Jonathan Pine, and I’m sure some of you will recognise Hugh Laurie from 101 Dalmations. It’s six 1-hour long episodes, and there is talk of renewing for a second season (fingers crossed!).

#### Power (Netflix)
Yep. This is the one with 50 Cent in it. But don’t let that put you off. It is all about drug dealers in NYC. The big fish and the street guys. There’s plenty of glitz and glam, many a steamy scene but also just enough grit. I have to say, however, that the show starts to feel dragged out by mid-way through season 3 and I did lose interest. That said, the first two seasons are excellent and definitely worth watching. PS Omari Hardwick, one of the main characters, is an absolute babe. The show really gets you rooting for things to go well for him.

#### The Good Place (Netlfix)
This is not my usual sort of show. It’s set in a completely fictional afterlife but has its fair share of twists and turns. The characters are funny and likeable and it’s a good light-hearted show to watch if you don’t fancy something with such an intense plot. Surprisingly, I can’t wait for them to renew for season 3. Perfect for bed time watching.

#### Big Little Lies (HBO, available through Amazon)
I loved this. It was more like an arts film than a regular TV show in terms of the cinematography. Very elegantly done, set in picturesque Monterey, where domestic life is about as far from idyllic as could be. Starring Reese Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley and Nicole Kidman, Big Little Lies follows the lives of these 3 very different mothers and their struggles as their children start school. Centred around a murder, the show uses flashbacks to the future (if that makes any sense!) to build suspense. (How to Get Away With Murder uses this technique too and I think it works really well to keep the viewer intrigued). I hear Meryl Streep is set to star in season 2 and I can’t wait! Again, 7 long episodes. Each one is more like watching a film.

### Recipe
